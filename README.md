# message-board-application
A simple flask web application that functions as a message board. This applicaion is my course project for "Tietokannat ja web-ohjelmointi 2023, II periodi"

My plan for this project is to create a simple message board application.

The application will allow an user to:

- post a new topic, choose a category for the post

- respond to existing topics

- view their own posts on their profile

- allow others to view other user's profiles and their posts , if set to public

- browse posts by category, date posted or amount of responses

Users will be divided into two categories, regular users and admin users.

An admin user will also be able to:

- delete any post or message

- block an user from posting

- view all profiles, even those set to private
